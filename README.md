This repository contains the code used for the experiment described in [Link to publication will be provided as soon as it is available]. The code was deployed to Heroku and used by the research team over the course of 85 days to support the production, distribution, and assessment of hundreds of health promotion messages across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with the highest degree of functional correctness and minimal human interaction.

The software code supports six functions: (1) data import; (2) message generation deploying randomization techniques to reduce selection bias; (3) message distribution across social media; (4) import of message comments and their toxicity score; (5) collection and display of message performance data; and (6) output reporting based on a predetermined data dictionary.

The code shown here is part of an ongoing project called [Trial Promoter](http://trialpromoter.org). If you'd like to view the latest version of the Trial Promoter code with bug fixes and feature enhancements, please switch to the master branch.
