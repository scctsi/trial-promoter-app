Allo is an investigational drug molecule shown in animal studies to stimulate the birth of new neurons, rescue cognition and lower indicators of Alzheimers disease.  
Objectives: 1) The first group of participants in the trial will be given one dose of Allo once per week for 12 weeks, only increasing the dose for the next group of participants when the lower dose has been shown to be safe.  The primary goal is to determine the highest dose that is safe and tolerated by participants.  2) Analysis will also be done on blood samples taken from participants at the beginning and end of the trial to determine how the body responds to the drug molecule. 3) As per FDA requirements, the trial will investigate potential safety concerns including blood vessel changes via brain imaging.  Secondary goals are to assess the short-term effects of Allo treatment on learning and memory as well as detect changes via MRI brain imaging to help researchers prepare for a larger-scale clinical trial. 
Study Population: The trial will enroll 24 participants (12 post-menopausal women, 12 men) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimers disease.  Participants must be 55 years of age or older, have a score on the Mini-Mental State Examination greater than 20, and be able to provide informed consent. 
Study Methodology: Participants will be given Allo or placebo intravenously once per week for 12 weeks.  
Description of Study Arms: Each dose (low to high) will have a separate, gender balanced group of 8 participants. 6 participants will be given Allo and 2 will be given placebo. At the end of the study, 18 participants will have received Allo and 6 will have received placebo.  
Endpoints: To determine the safety and tolerability of Allo, the trial will evaluate 1) if any, how much sedation after each dose of Allo; 2) if any, how many side-effects participants report; 3) any clinically significant changes in participants (for example: blood tests, weight, heart rate, heart monitor, brain scan, tests of memory) and 4) changes in brain imaging.

      The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields, TTF) has
      been tested in a large prospective, randomized trial, in 237 recurrent GBM patients. The
      outcome of subjects treated with the NovoTTF-100A device was compared to those treated with
      an effective best standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF-100A
      subjects had comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available
      chemotherapy in the US today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF-100A to BSC
      chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints.

      Recurrent GBM patients treated with the NovoTTF-100A device in this trial experienced fewer
      side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side effects, and
      significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse events compared
      to controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to moderate skin
      irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures were better in
      NovoTTF-100A subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving effective best standard
      of care chemotherapy.

      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

      Patients with GBM whose disease has first recurred despite standard treatment (Surgery,
      radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for
      participation in the study will be recruited to one of two groups based on patient
      preference alone:

        1. Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device, or

        2. Treatment with the best standard of care practiced at each of the participating
           centers.

      If recruited to the best standard of care group, patients will receive a chemotherapeutic
      agent chosen based on their prior treatments and the standard of care practiced at each
      treating center.

      If recruited to the NovoTTF-100A group, the patients will be treated continuously until
      tumor progression. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically
      insulated electrodes on the head. Electrode placement will require shaving of the scalp
      before treatment. Patients will continue treatment at home where they can maintain their
      regular daily routine.

      During the trial, regardless of whether assigned to the NovoTTF-100A treatment group or the
      best standard of care group, patients will need to return once every month the hospital
      outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician. These routine visits will
      continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing.

      During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically, as
      well as fill in neuro-cognitive questionnaires. Adverse events data will be collected from
      all patients.. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by
      telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.

      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

      The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are
      multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a
      way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature
      building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place
      to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of
      electric charge.

      As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after
      continuous exposure to TTFields.

      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.

      In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very
      few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.",HS-13-00840,,,,Data Collection only,,"Inclusion Criteria:

      nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      III. To evaluate whether the addition of chest wall + regional nodal XRT after mastectomy or

Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before surgery or NAC) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced breast cancer because it can significantly increase patients chances of having breast-conserving surgery while also reducing the future risk of the disease returning and death. A good estimate of tumor size and an accurate prediction of patient response to NAC are critical for the clinical management of patients since the degree of disease response at surgery corresponds to survival. The importance of ultrasound (US) examination in the diagnosis of breast cancer has been widely demonstrated. During the last few years, the introduction of US contrast media has been considered a promising tool for studying the blood vessel pattern of tumors. Contrast enhanced US (CEUS) involves the use of microbubble contrast agents and specialized imaging techniques to show blood flow and tissue perfusion information. The application of CEUS in the response assessment of breast cancer is still at an experimental stage, with varying success in different studies. Further studies are needed to verify whether CEUS could predict the mid- to long-term effects of NAC and potentially serve as a biomarker. Elastography (EG) is a new imaging technique that uses US to assess the elastic properties of tissue by measuring tissue changes in response to sound waves. Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) measures the degree of change in tissue in response to transmitted pulsations from nearby blood vessels. Many studies have shown that a combination of SWE and US had the best results in detecting cancer and could potentially reduce unnecessary biopsies. This study proposes to determine whether the combined real time CEUS and SWE techniques can serve as a biomarker for tumor response assessment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer who receive NAC. Once participants sign the informed consent and are deemed eligible for the study, participants will have a CEUS and SWE before starting NAC, 2-3 weeks after starting NAC, and before surgery. Participants will have a pregnancy test and a follow-up phone call 24 hours after the CEUS and SWE procedures. All participants will complete the study once all of the CEUS and SWE scans have been done. The primary outcome will be to correlate CEUS with treatment response and assess whether or not it can serve as an early response assessment biomarker for NAC. Classification and Regression Tree (CART 6.0) will be used to establish the prediction rule. Weighted Kappa will be used to assess the agreement between model predicted treatment response (for CEUS and SWE) and pathologically determined treatment response. Weighted Kappa will also be used to assess the agreement between treatment response predicted by novel ultrasound techniques and contrast enhanced (CE) MRI. Scatter plots and contingency tables will be used to identify discordant cases between US techniques and CE MRI.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a protocol-approved chemotherapy regimen based on the patient and/or
      physician preference. Patients then receive a protocol-approved adjuvant endocrine therapy
      comprising tamoxifen citrate, an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or
      exemestane), or both for 5-10 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive a protocol-approved endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen citrate,
      an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane), or both for 5-10 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may complete health-related quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires at baseline and
      periodically during study. Information on Medicare and/or insurance coverage and on health
      coverage decisions may also be collected periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for at least 15 years.",,,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

PARP is a nuclear enzyme that recognizes DNA damage and facilitates DNA repair. However, DNA-damaging agents, including cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, remain a mainstay of treatment for breast cancer.  Veliparib  in a PARP inhibitor that increases sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents and delays the repair of DNA damage.

The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence of pathological complete response after treatment. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the rate of eligibility for breast conservation after therapy. 

Participants will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the following three treatment arms:
Arm A) paclitaxel + carboplatin + veliparib followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
Arm B) paclitaxel + carboplatin followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
Arm C) paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide

After completing study therapy, the subject will undergo local-regional treatment consisting of surgery with or without radiotherapy

Approximately 624 participants will take part in this study at 200 study sites.

Pathological Complete Response (pCR) will be the primary endpoint and is defined by the absence of any residual invasive cancer following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The co-primary efficacy analyses are defined by comparing pCR in two pairwise comparisons of Arm A versus Arm B and Arm A versus Arm C. Both comparisons in the co-primary analyses need to be statistically significant to claim efficacy of veliparib.",HS-14-00360,Anayansi,Miloud,Anayansi.miloud@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 3 - a treatment has shown activity against a particular disease, where it is either added to existing treatment or compared to the standard treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

Costs and Quality of Life of Women with Breast Cancer","This proposed randomized trial of preoperative breast MRI in patients deemed eligible for breast conserving surgery by conventional clinical criteria will provide important information about the clinical and biologic relevance of occult disease identified by MRI alone. To distinguish whether preoperative breast MRI improves local staging and ultimately improves local regional control, the study team propose that women deemed eligible for BCT (breast conserving therapy) by standard criteria be randomized between current standard of care, clinical examination and mammography (+/- ultrasound) and current standard of care plus preoperative breast MRI. In order to maximize the probability of deriving benefit from preoperative MRI, the study will focus on women with ER/PR/HER-2 negative (triple negative) and HER-2 amplified breast cancers. This multicenter trial will target women at the highest risk of local recurrence and test the hypothesis that increased rates of multifocality and multicentricity in this population accounts for the higher reported rates of local recurrence. Main Objective: The main objective of this trial is to compare the rates of local-regional recurrence (LRR) following attempted breast conserving therapy in a cohort of women with triple negative or HER-2 amplified breast cancer randomized to preoperative staging with mammography (control arm) or mammography plus breast MRI (MRI arm).Participants: Women are eligible if they have been pathologically-diagnosed (by needle biopsy; surgical excision is excluded) with clinical stage I-II (T1-3 N0 M0, T0-2 N1 M0) and either:             a.

ER negative/PR negative (< 10% by IHC staining)                and HER-2 amplified tumors as determined IHC 3+ or by FISH (amplification > 2.2).Study Design Summary: A total of 488 eligible women with breast cancer will be enrolled in the study. (Target maximum accrual to account for withdrawals and ineligible women is 536.) It is anticipated that accrual will be completed in 1.5 years with a minimum of 16 patients enrolled in a year.

(The METRIC Study)","This study is for females that have been diagnosed with metastatic (i.e., cancer that has spread) triple negative breast cancer (breast cancer that does not have hormone receptors or HER2) and have received no more than one prior chemotherapy treatment for advanced (locally advanced / recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer.  CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is an experimental drug. CDX-011 consists of an antibody attached to a drug, MMAE, that can kill cancer cells, which is intended to work by specifically directing the drug to the cancer cell. The purpose of this study is to see whether CDX-011 is effective in treating research participants who have advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC; i.e., tumors lacking expression of estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors) that contains GPNMB, and to examine the side effects associated with CDX-011 treatment.  This study will be conducted at 100  150 centers in the US, Canada and Australia and will include approximately 300 research participants.  There are three phases of study procedures,  the screening phase (to make sure you are eligible to participate in the study), the treatment phase, and the follow up phase.  This is an open-label, prospectively controlled, randomized study.  Eligible participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive CDX-011 or capecitabine.  CDX-011 will be administered on Day 1 of repeated 21 day cycles. The starting CDX-011 dose is 1.88 mg/kg, given as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Treatment will continue until progression.Capecitabine will be orally administered on Days 1-14 of repeated 21 day cycles. The recommended capecitabine starting dose is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily.  Safety will be assessed by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations and the incidence and severity of adverse events.Anti-tumor activity will be assessed via ORR, DOR, PFS and OS. Tumor response and progression will be defined by an independent review committee, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.Patients will be monitored for the development of anti-CDX-011 and anti-CR011 antibodies, and whether these antibodies are neutralizing.Population PK analyses will be performed to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters and to explore the relationships between patient-specific measures of exposure and safety and activity parameters; the influence of key intrinsic factors, such as weight and gender, on variability in PK will also be evaluated. The impact of circulating GPNMB levels on pharmacokinetic parameters may also be examined.Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated via assessment of tumor tissue obtained via voluntary biopsy or re-resection. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. All randomized patients will be included in the primary efficacy analysis according to their assigned study treatment, irrespective of the actual treatment received. The primary analysis of safety will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment.A futility analysis of ORR will be performed once 90 patients are evaluable for response (either achieve an objective response of PR or CR, discontinue treatment, or complete the 18-week disease assessment).",HS-13-00810,Anayansi,Miloud,Anayansi.miloud@med.usc.edu,Drug,Phase 2/3 - for trials that are a combination of phases 2 and 3.,"Inclusion Criteria:

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a complex phenomenon consisting of both acute (024 h) and delayed (24120 h) components, which respond differently to currently available therapies.Effective antiemetic regimens for highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy have historically been based on the combination of a serotonin antagonist and a corticosteroid. This combination is highly effective for the control of acute emesis but less so for delayed emesis.It has been reported that a single dose of the intravenous formulation of aprepitant (Fosaprepitant) is equivalent to a standard 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant.While Sancuso provides extended release of granisetron for up to 7 days, its efficacy for the prevention of delayed emesis has not been well studied.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of fosaprepitant and granisetron transdermal system in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. And the secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the combination of fosaprepitant and granisetron transdermal system in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This is a pilot single institution dose study.  Patients will be provided with granisetron transdermal system (skin patch) that will be applied 24-48 hrs prior to the administration of chemotherapy. Patients will wear the patch for 7 days. On the day of chemotherapy administration patients will be premedicated with fosaprepitant 150 mg IV on day 1. Patients will receive standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on day 1. Patients will receive 4 cycles repeated every 2 or 3 weeks as clinically indicated. Patients will receive decadron 12 mg PO or IV on Day 1; 8 mg PO on Day 2; and 8 mg PO BID on Days 3 and 4. A blood sample will be collected at baseline for SNPs. A single-arm 2-stage design will be used to test whether the proposed antiemetic regimen improves the complete response in women and men with breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy. The complete response is the primary endpoint, defined as no acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and no use of rescue medication within 120 hours after the first administration of an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Baseline patient characteristics (age, breast cancer stage, etc) will be presented to describe women and men treated in this study. The complete response rate with the exact 95% CIs will be calculated. The associations between the complete response rate and patient characteristics and biomarkers will be examined using Fishers exact test or Mann-Whitney U test whenever appropriate. The analyses will be exploratory in nature and be used to generate hypotheses for further studies.Patients will be instructed to use Daily Diary Log Sheets (Appendix I) to document any nausea, vomiting, retching, and rescue medication used from Days 1 to 4 of each cycle of treatment (Day 1 = Day of treatment). Study investigators (or designated research personnel  i.e.:  co-PIs or research coordinators) will call all patients on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle of treatment to encourage patients to complete the Daily Diary Log Sheets, and to collect information on any toxicities experienced. The study investigators will collect the Daily Diary Log Sheets when the patient returns to clinic for follow-up visit with each cycle of treatment. Study PI, co-PIs, or research coordinators will interview the patients and grade the severity of nausea and vomiting using CTCAE version 4.0 criteria.

      Primary

        -  To compare whether the addition of one year of everolimus (10 mg daily) to standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in patients
           with high-risk, hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, and human epidermal growth factor
           receptor (HER)2-negative breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare whether the addition of one year of everolimus to standard adjuvant
           endocrine therapy improves overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free survival
           (DRFS) in this patient population.

        -  To evaluate the safety, toxicities, and tolerability of one year of everolimus in
           combination with standard adjuvant endocrine therapy and to compare it with standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy plus placebo in this patient population.

        -  To determine whether the benefit of one year of everolimus use in addition to standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy varies by recurrence score (RS), nodal status, or other
           commonly used prognostic factors.

        -  To evaluate adherence to 1-year treatment of everolimus in comparison to placebo in
           addition to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in this patient population.

        -  To collect specimens in order to evaluate biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk level
      (node-negative and recurrence score [RS] > 25 in the primary tumor, and a tumor measuring ƒ?
      2 cm in greatest diameter treated with adjuvant therapy vs 1-3 positive lymph nodes and RS >
      25 treated with adjuvant therapy vs ƒ? 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] treated with
      adjuvant therapy vs ƒ? 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] prior to or after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen citrate*,
           goserelin acetate** or leuprolide acetate**, or aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole,
           letrozole, or exemestane) for 2-5 years. Patients also receive a placebo orally (PO)
           daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy regimen as in arm I. Patients
           also receive everolimus PO daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Men receive tamoxifen citrate PO for 5 years.

      NOTE: **Goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate is given if patient is or becomes
      postmenopausal.

        -  All patients will undergo surgery to identify sentinel lymph node(s). If a lymph node
           (sentinel or non-sentinel) is determined to be positive on intra-operative pathology
           the patient will be registered/randomized intra-operatively.

           registered/randomized to the study.

        -  Patients whose sentinel lymph node status is cannot be/is not determined intra-
           operatively, and have not undergone ALND, but had at least one lymph node (sentinel or
           non-sentinel) found to be positive on final pathology review will be

           registered/randomized, but can be offered participation in another cooperative group
           trial.

      The primary and secondary objectives of the study are described below. Please see the ""Arms""
      section for a detailed description of the treatment regimens.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
           inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes
           but not to the dissected axilla in terms of invasive breast cancer recurrence-free
           interval in patients with positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
           inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes
           but not to the dissected axilla in terms of the incidence of invasive loco-regional
           recurrences in patients with a positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy

        -  To obtain an estimate of the distribution of residual disease burden scores for each
           treatment arm

        -  To estimate the distribution of overall survival for each treatment arm

      Patients may receive adjuvant and ancillary therapy as appropriate per the protocol.

      Adjuvant Therapy:

        -  Adjuvant endocrine therapy: Patients with hormone receptor (ER and/or PR) positive
           disease should receive a minimum of 5 years of standard endocrine therapy (experimental
           agents/regimens are not permitted). Endocrine therapy should begin following completion
           of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, either before, during or after radiation
           therapy at the discretion of the oncologist. Selection of the agents is at the treating
           physician's discretion.

        -  Patients with HER 2 positive disease should complete a total of one year of trastuzumab
           therapy (over the neoadjuvant and adjuvant period).

        -  Chemotherapy, biologic therapy or vaccine therapy in the adjuvant setting is not
           allowed.

      Patients who wish to receive any of these therapies after surgery must go off study at the
      time of their initiation.

      Ancillary Therapy:

        -  Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood
           products, erythropoetin (unless otherwise specified in the protocol), antibiotics,
           antiemetics, etc. when appropriate.

The most common method for breast cancer screening is mammography, which is an x-ray of the breast. Although a mammogram may find tumors that are too small to feel, it has limitations as a screening test. These include the use of x-ray radiation and uncomfortable compression of an individuals breast. Also, the ability of a mammogram to find breast cancer may depend on the size of the tumor, the density of the breast tissue, and the skill of the radiologist. Mammograms are less likely to find breast tumors in women younger than 50 years than in older women. This may be because younger women have denser breast tissue that appears white on a mammogram resulting in missed cancers or in the discovery of later stage cancers. Light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS) is based on the science of diffusion in which light is scattered from its point of origin and interacts with another medium.  When a beam of light comes into contact with an object, the light is absorbed, reflected, and/or scattered.  After the light has been scattered, the measurements can be collected and analyzed. Recent advances have allowed for the noninvasive detection of precancerous lesions by using LSS.  This approach has been validated for detection of precancerous polyps in the colon and pancreatic cancer.We propose a pilot study to predict the presence of breast cancer through the assessment of the tissue in the nipple using LSS, thereby eliminating the need for any direct examination or radiographic imaging of the inside of the breast. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether LSS can reliably distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical confirmed stage II or stage III breast cancer and those without breast cancer. If successful, this technology could lead to a safer, less expensive method of breast cancer screening.Patients who agree to take part will have two assessments with the LSS probe done on each breast. They will not be followed after the assessments and their participation will end once the assessments have been completed.The data will be coded, classified, and ranked for each group. These results will be compared to the tumor status of each breast and the number of correct classifications counted. The accuracy of the classifications will be associated with the ability of the device to predict the presence of disease. Optical markers will also be analysed using multivariate analyses. The results will be evaluated and will be used to determine if the device warrants further investigation in this type of cancer.",HS-12-00548,Maria,Brown,Maria.Brown@med.usc.edu,Device,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Tivantinib is metabolized mostly through the liver and the FDA recommends that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study be conducted in patients with impaired liver function if the drug is eliminated through the liver. PK studies look at what the body does to the drug in terms of how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted. This open-label, Phase 1 study is being done with a primary objective to evaluate the impact of liver impairment on the PK of tivantinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors as compared to those with normal liver function. There will be 4 groups of liver function evaluated (Group 1  Control: normal, Group 2: mild impairment, Group 3: moderate impairment, and Group 4: severe impairment).

Once patients have signed consent and are deemed eligible, they will be assigned to one of four groups according to their liver function status. Each group will have a minimum of 6 subjects. The subjects will have tests and procedures done as listed in the protocol. The study will be done in 2 phases. The first phase is the primary objective phase. All subjects will receive one dose of tivantinib and have PK bloods collected for up to 4 days. They will enter into the extension phase if they are willing and the study doctor thinks that they will benefit. The dose of tivantinib in the extension phase will depend on which group they are in. They will continue to have study visits and receive study drug until they have side effect(s) which require their removal from the study, they are lost to follow up, their disease progresses, they die, the protocol is not followed, they withdraw consent or the sponsor stops the study. 

The PK and safety data will be summarized and analyzed by liver function group and also by dosing group. Disposition and reasons for discontinuation will be listed and summarized for all subjects. The demographic and baseline variables will be descriptively summarized for all subjects. Population PK analysis will be conducted by pooling data from other tivantinib studies. Additionally, the AUCtau and Cmax will also be calculated.

        - Patients ƒ? 18 years of age.

        - Patients with newly diagnosed GCT

          -  Pathology confirmation of GCT histology at MSKCC or a collaborating treating
             institution. In exceptional circumstances, patients without pathological diagnosis
             may be included in the study following discussion with the national principal
             investigator, Dr. Feldman,(or national Co-PI or MSKCC Co-PI if the national PI is
             unavailable) if they meet the one of the following criteria:

               -  Patients with a testicular mass (detected clinically and/or by ultrasound),
                  and/or mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or pineal tumor AND
                  elevated serum tumor markers (HCG and/or AFP). Patients with elevated LDH only
                  will not be included without pathological confirmation of GCT since LDH is a
                  nonspecific marker for GCT and could potentially be elevated in other
                  malignancies such as lymphomas.

        This is because patients may present with a clinical scenario consistent with GCT
        (elevated serum tumor markers, testicular mass and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy) with a
        concurrent life-threatening oncologic emergency that require immediate treatment. In this
        case, initial treatment without biopsy confirmation is usually recommended and tissue
        confirmation may be obtained after initiating therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Patients who received prior radiation therapy (RT) for treatment of germ cell tumor
             are eligible for this study as long as there is evidence of progressive disease
             determined by tumor markers or other sites of metastases outside of the radiated
             site. Radiation must be completed prior to starting chemotherapy with the exception
             of brain metastases where chemotherapy and radiation can be given concurrently.
             Toxicity from radiation must have recovered to grade 1 or less prior to initiating
             chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have recovered from prior surgery based on treating physician's
             discretion.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception during
             the period of therapy

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin ƒ?60%
             predicted, except if related to high volume metastatic GCT to the lungs in which case
             there is no minimum DLCO requirement. In some cases, patients  may not be able to
             undergo PFT testing due to the severity of their presentation. such as those with
             high volume lung metastases or tumor-related pain (from large mediastinal masses,
             pleural disease, etc.) limiting their ability to complete PFTs. Since there is no
             minimum DLCO for these patients, under these extraordinary circumstances, this will
             be allowed. Most patients in this situation will be expected to receive
             disease-stabilizing chemotherapy. An unadjusted DLCO may be used in place of the DLCO
             adjusted for hemoglobin in certain situations as per institutional policy. For
             example, MSKCC policy is to not adjust the DLCO for hemoglobin when the hemoglobin is
             ƒ? 14.6 g/dL for males and ƒ? 13.4 g/dL for females. In these cases, the unadjusted
             DLCO must be >60% predicted.

          -  Laboratory criteria for protocol entry (obtained ƒ?? 14 days before initiation of
             therapy):

               -  Serum creatinine ƒ?? 1.5 mg/dL or estimated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault) ƒ?50mL/min or
                  12 or 24 hour urine creatinine clearance ƒ? 50 mL/min, unless renal insufficiency
                  is due to tumoral ureteral obstruction in which case eligibility will be
                  determined by national the principal investigator (or national co-PI or MSKCC
                  co-PI if the national PI is unavailable) with notification of the MSKCC IRB.

               -  AST/ALT ƒ?? 3 x ULN and total bilirubin ƒ?? 2.0 x ULN. In the setting of metastatic
                  disease to the liver, AST/ALT may be ƒ??5x ULN and total bilirubin ƒ??2.5 x ULN. If
                  a patient is known or suspected to have Gilbert's disease, total bilirubin up to

This is a Phase I trial that will investigate the oral administration of the drugs, which was shown to be feasible in an expansion of the previous trial.The main objective is to establish the safety and tolerability of oral FdCyd in combination with oral THU.  Escalating doses of the study drug combination will be given and side effects recorded. Three patients will be treated at each new dose level.

      primary peritoneal cancer and who are randomized to a healthy lifestyle intervention, will
      have significantly increased progression-free survival compared to similar women who are
      randomized to a usual care comparison group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if women who are randomized to the study intervention will have improved
      general quality of life as measured by the General Health subscale of RAND 36-Item Health
      Survey (RAND-36).

      II. To determine if women who are randomized to the study intervention will have improved

      and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),
      compared to women who are randomized to usual care.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient compliance with the healthy lifestyle intervention by analyzing
      biomarkers (e.g., total carotenoid) at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months.

      II. To explore the relationship between carotenoid exposure and progression free survival
      from ovarian cancer.

      III. To examine patient compliance with the healthy lifestyle intervention and to assess
      which types of patients are more likely to be compliant with the healthy lifestyle
      intervention and whether progression-free survival is better among compliant individuals.

      IV. To explore the impact of the intervention on other aspects of quality of life such as
      pain, role limitations due to physical health and emotional problems, mental health,
      vitality, and social functioning as measured by the corresponding subscales of the RAND-36.

      V. To explore the impact of the intervention on bowel functioning as measured with the
      GSRS-IBS subscales.

      VI. To assess the association between subjectively measured sleep duration/quality (using
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale), anthropometric measurements, and self-reported dietary
      energy intake among women previously treated for stage II-IV ovarian or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      cancer survivors randomized to lifestyle intervention versus standard of care.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 1: (lifestyle intervention) Participants receive a dietary intervention designed to
      promote increased levels of plasma carotenoids, control weight, and to ensure adequacy of
      micronutrient intake. Participants also undergo a physical activity intervention comprising
      a moderately low aerobic regimen to raise the usual activity level. Participants also
      undergo face-to-face counseling, receive educational materials and counseling focused on how
      to read food labels to estimate grams of fat per serving and serving size, and undergo
      telephone counseling by a lifestyle intervention counselor once a week for 4 weeks, then
      twice a month for 6 months, monthly for the subsequent 6 months, and then once every other
      month for 11 months. Participants complete daily fat gram and step diaries at least three
      times per week.

      GROUP 2: (comparison lifestyle) Participants receive a study notebook containing general
      study-related information. Participants are not asked to record diet or physical activity
      but are provided a single sample diary in their study notebook. Participants receive
      telephone contact on a sliding scale similar to the intervention group, but at less frequent
      intervals (22 versus 33 calls over the course of the intervention).

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      sEphB4-HSA.

      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities and adverse event profile of sEphB4-HSA in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics of sEphB4-HSA. IV. To describe the anti-tumor activity
      of sEphB4-HSA as manifested by responses to treatment.

      V. To obtain preliminary evaluation of effect of sEphB4-HSA on absolute circulating tumor
      cell (CTC) numbers as compared with pre-treatment levels using pre- and during treatment
      CTC. Exploratory evaluation of effect of sEphB4-HSA on downstream protein mediators of the
      Ephrin pathway (pAKT, pSrc) and their transcriptional target genes (rgs5 and psenen) will be
      performed.

      VI. To collect pilot information to identify a dose or doses with biologic activity.
      Biologic activity after treatment with sEphB4-HSA will be defined as evidence of
      drug-on-target effect as manifested by reduction in absolute CTC numbers. Other exploratory
      evaluations of drug-on-target effect such as increase in transcript levels of psenen or rgs5
      may be considered in the assessment of biologic activity.

Tests were done on these research participants and they have shown that their cancer either has become smaller or has not grown since being treated with NKTR-102 they are eligible to continue treatment.   During the study, the research participants  will continue to receive the study drug in the same way that they received the study drug when they were part of the previous NKTR-102 study drug trial.  The purpose of this study is to test whether NKTR-102, is safe and effective in treating research participants with cancer.  This study will also look at how this type of cancer responds to the study drug, and it will look at the side effects of the study drug.  It will also observe disease progression and survival status.NKTR-102 is an experimental drug.  It slowly releases irinotecan (or Camptosar); this allows irinotecan to stay in the body much longer.  Irinotecan is approved in multiple countries worldwide for treatment of colorectal cancer and has been used for many years.   This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in subjects with refractory solid tumors with ongoing clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) to previous treatment with NKTR-102.The study period is approximately 5 years.  Depending on the dose and schedule used at the conclusion of the original protocol, NKTR-102 will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 60-90 min on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.Duration of Treatment: Subjects will continue to receive study drug treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal by the subject, Principal Investigator decision, lost to follow-up, or study terminated by Sponsor.The endpoints are:  incidence and duration of toxicities, with severity grading according to NCI-CTCAE.

BMS-906024 is being developed as a cancer treatment because it may stop a specific pathway that tumor cells use to grow and survive. Signaling pathways determine how cells use information.  The pathway that is being inhibited by BMS-906024 is called the Notch pathway and is part of a network of pathways that control tumor cell growth and new blood vessel formation within tumors. Various different solid tumor types use this pathway to grow and survive. This study is the first time that BMS-906024 is combined with chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy regimens are paclitaxel, FOLFIRI (combination of 5-fluoruracil, leucovorin and irinotecan) and carboplatin/paclitaxel. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of BMS-906 024 given with one of the chemotherapy regimens. The secondary objectives are how the body takes up BMS-906024 (drug concentrations will be measured in the blood), paclitaxel, irinotecan, SN38 and 5FU and paclitaxel and carboplatin when given alone and in combination with the BMS-906024.  Preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of the different combination regimens will also be determined.  Potential predictive biomarkers such as NOTCH gene alterations or expression status of components of the NOTCH pathway will also be assessed. The tumor types planned to be tested in this study include colorectal cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  Other tumors types will be allowed during both parts of the study. About 96 subjects are expected to participate in this study, with approximately 4-6 centers globally.   This is a Phase 1B dose escalation chemotherapy combination study, testing IV dosing (multiple dose levels of BMS-906024 with three different chemotherapy regimens.  The study will remain open until the MTD or pre-specified maximum dose level of the combination of BMS-906024 and the three chemotherapy regimens is defined and enrollment into the expansion groups is completed. There are three additional chemotherapy cohort added to the study. The primary endpoints for the study are frequencies of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, death, grade 3 and 4 AEs, and grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. The secondary endpoints are:  Pharmacokinetics, tumor response, best overall response (BOR), duration of response and progression free survival (PFS) and biomarker endpoints. Safety Analysis:  All recorded AEs will be listed and tabulated by the study drug dose and chemotherapy treatment group.  Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by the study drug dose and chemotherapy treatment group.  Any significant physical examination findings, ECG abnormalities and clinical laboratory results will be listed. Efficacy Analysis:  Individual tumor responses and progression free survival will be listed.  Best overall response and duration of response will be summarized.  PFS will be plotted and the median PFS time together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be provided. Pharmacokinetics Analysis:  Summary statistics will be tabulated for the PK parameters of the study drug by dose and chemotherapy treatment group. Pharmacodynamics Analysis:  Summary statistics for pharmacodynamic markers and corresponding changes from baseline expression levels will be tabulated by study drug dose and chemotherapy treatment group. Predictive Biomarkers: To identify potential predictive biomarkers, association between expression levels of Notch activation markers or mutation status of NOTCH and tumor responses will be explored.  Appropriate statistical methods, including but not limited to logistic (or COX) regression, may be used to study the relationship between baseline biomarker levels or changes from baseline and tumor responses (or PFS) to treatment.",HS-12-00575,Anayansi,Miloud,Anayansi.miloud@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 1 - a new treatment that has not been tested, and researchers are looking for the best way to administer the treatment and how much can be given safely.

","Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Poly neuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired neurological, demyelinating neuropathy with an assumed autoimmune mediated pathogenesis.  The prevalence of CIDP is estimated to be about 4.7 per 100,000 adult and about 0.5 per 100,000 children. This study is being conducted to provide SCIG (Sub Cuteneous Immunoglobulin) as an alternative treatment option for CIDP instead of IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) that allows the subject to self-administer the product in the home setting. The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of 2 different doses of IgPro20 (0.2 g/kg bw and/or 0.4 g/kg bw) in the maintenance treatment of CIDP in comparison to placebo. The secondary objectives of the study are to measures of IgPro20 efficacy in CIDP and to investigate the safety and tolerability of IgPro20 in comparison to placebo.

This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group study with 3 arms to investigate 2 different doses of IgPro20 SC (sub cuteneous) compared to placebo SC for maintenance IgG (Immunoglobulin) treatment of subjects with CIDP who are on a stable IVIG maintenance treatment before the study.  The study duration will be up 52 weeks, including Screening, IVIG Dependency Test Period, IVIG Re-stabilization Period and SC Treatment Period.  After screening, eligible subject will undergo an IVIG withdrawal period of up to 12 weeks to test for ongoing need for IgG.  Only subjects experiencing CIDP relapse during the IVIG withdrawal are eligible for the subsequent IVIG Re-stabilization period lasting for 10 or 13 weeks, followed by weekly SC treatment infusion of IgPro20 or placebo on 1 or 2 consecutive days for 24 weeks.

Patients usually develop a skin rash within three weeks after the start of treatment with cetuximab.  The eruption is characterized by inflammatory papules and pustules most often seen on the face, chest, and back but occasionally extends to the extremities and generally is not dose limiting.  The discomfort and physical appearance of the rash can affect patients activities of daily living, quality of life, and adherence to treatment.  Scratching secondary to pruritis can break down the skin causing secondary infection. Skin biopsies of these eruptions demonstrate lymphocytic perifolliculitis or suppurative superficial folliculitis without infectious etiology. It has been shown that this papulopustular rash resulted in decreased quality of life as well as causing dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation of EGFRI treatment. Interests in this papulopustular rash have increased over time due to published data suggesting a possible relationship between rash and treatment response and/or patient survival.As of today, no standardized treatment or guideline has been identified as the optimal approach to prevent or treat EGFRI-induced skin toxicity. The continual evidence supporting the positive correlation of skin rash as a response surrogate marker supports the need for effective interventions to control symptomatic skin toxicity in order to minimize the need for dose modification or interruption of the primary treatment, including patient non-adherence to the treatment regimen.  There is no optimal toxicity grading scale that providers can use to adequately evaluate and document the observed dermatologic effects.  The lack of an adequate measure makes it difficult for providers to appropriately modify treatment dose based on skin toxicities.  It would be very helpful to have a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to complement the CTCAE measure and enhance clinicians ability to accurately assess the severity and effect of skin toxicity symptoms.  The FACT-EGFRI 18 is a PRO measure to assess dermatologic-related symptom burden and HRQL among patients receiving EGFRIs.  The proposed validation study offers the opportunity to obtain preliminary validation data for the FACT-EGFRI 18 questionnaire as a PRO measure with the intention to establish its role as a complementary tool to be used in conjunction with the 7-item NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The goal is to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of EGFRI-induced skin-related toxicities in order to promote optimal supportive care for this patient population.Study participants will complete a questionnaire and a change in skin symptoms form (starting Day 8) on Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 71, 99, and 127, to include blood withdrawal of approximately 15ml on pre-study, Day 15, 29, 43,71, 99, and 127.The primary objective of this study is to establish the psychometric properties of the newinstrument measuring skin toxicity due to EGFRI-based treatment, the FACT Questionnaire for EGFR Inhibitor Toxicities (FACT-EGFRI 18), and to establish validity for all patients (Caucasian and non-Caucasian).  A total of n=140 eligible patients will be enrolled. Since an estimated 80% of all patients treated with EGFRI are expected to develop EGFRI-associated skin toxicity, 140 eligible patients will give 112 evaluable patients.No further follow-up will be required once the patient completes last protocol assessment (Day 127).",HS-12-00072,Maria,Brown,Maria.Brown@med.usc.edu,Data Collection only,,"DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

For instance, in a cooperative group chemoprevention pilot study involving surgically resected colorectal cancer patients, the 3-year cumulative adenoma recurrence rate exceeded 30%.  Adenomatous polyps are generally regarded as precursors to colorectal cancer and relatively late surrogates in the carcinogenic pathway to the development of these malignancies.  Experimental interventions in several animal models have demonstrated that NSAIDs and eflornithine inhibit carcinogenesis including adenoma formation and colon cancer.  the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac, in combination with eflornithine, has demonstrated efficacy in prevention of recurrent polyps among adenoma patients in a randomized Phase III trial compared to placebo treatment.The main objective of this study is to assess whether eflornithine (+/- sulindac), sulindac (+/- eflornithine) or the combination are effective in reducing the three-year event rate (high-risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers) in patients with previously treated Stage 0-III colon cancer.  Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment groups: 1) eflornithine placebo and sulindac placebo; 2) eflornithine and sulindac placebo; 3) eflornithine placebo and sulindac; 4) eflornithine and sulindac. Study participants will take the study drug for 36 months. They will be seen again one month after completing the study intervention, and once a year for 5 years to check his/her general health. USC is a designated site for the optional pharmacokinetic study and participants will have the option to take part in this additional study. A dynamic balancing algorithm will be used for randomization with stratification by risk of recurrence as follows: Stage 0/I vs. Stage II with no prior chemotherapy vs. Stage II with prior chemotherapy vs. Stage III.  The primary endpoint is the 3-year event rate after registration among Stage 0-III colon cancer patients. An event is defined as high risk adenoma or 2nd primary colorectal cancer. High risk adenoma is defined as either advanced adenoma (villous or tubulovillous histology, size  1 cm, or high grade dysplasia) or multiple adenomas (3 or more each > 0.3 cm).",HS-11-00535,Maria,Brown,Maria.Brown@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 3 - a treatment has shown activity against a particular disease, where it is either added to existing treatment or compared to the standard treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

The standard treatment is surgery, but the cancer recurs in 10-20% of cases. To decrease recurrence, chemotherapy and radiation are given before surgery. However, radiation with chemotherapy has not been shown to improve overall survival, so chemotherapy is also given for 3-4 months after surgery. Radiation is also associated with short and long term side effects and has differing effects on survival depending on the stage of disease, but the degree of tumor response after radiation with chemotherapy is associated with survival. Thus, tumor response or complete pathologic response (CPR) appears to be a good indicator for long term outcomes. A previous study has shown that chemotherapy without radiation using FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin, Leukovorin and Fluororacil) and Bevacizumab yields a CPR rate of 27% and does not compromise the removal of the tumor with surgery. This Phase II study will attempt to validate the results of that study using FOLFOX and Bevacizumab without radiation in patients with rectal cancer that has not spread and can be removed surgically. This study will also assess the rate that the tumor recurs and assess specific biomarkers that may be associated with tumor response.Once participants sign the informed consent and are deemed eligible for the study, participants will receive a modified FOLFOX regimen, called mFOLFOX7, with Bevacizumab through a vein in the arm every 2 weeks. Every 2 weeks is called a cycle. During the study, participants will have the following procedures done during each cycle: a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, performance status, assessment of side effects, review of medications, and tumor assessments with ultrasound and radiographic scans at the end of study treatment before surgery. All participants will stop taking study drug(s) if their disease worsens, they will not have surgery, they have another illness which prevents them from taking the study drug(s), they cannot tolerate the side effects, they withdraw from the study, or their study doctor thinks that being on the study is no longer in their best interest. All participants will be followed every 3 months after stopping the study drug(s) for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.The primary endpoint of this study is complete pathologic response. A two-stage Simon design was used to calculate sample size. All subjects will be analyzed as intent to treat. Biomarkers will be analyzed using a contingency table, bar plots, Fisher's exact test, scatterplots, and two-sample Wilcoxon or t-test. An optimal cut-off value of the continuous biomarker will be chosen to separate patients into 2 groups in term of probability of CPR using the maximal chi-square approach. P value for the associations will be adjusted using bootstrap like simulations.

While patients are generally required to be previously untreated, participation in a Phase II trial doesn't usually preclude the patient from getting the standard treatment after they've received the investigational agent. At best they are allowed to get a new drug they wouldn't be able to get otherwise that may turn out to be better for their disease.","Inclusion Criteria:

      l. To determine if trastuzumab increases disease-free survival when combined with
      trimodality treatment (radiation plus chemotherapy followed by surgery) for patients with
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment increases the
      pathologic complete response rate and overall survival for patients with HER2-overexpressing
      esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      II. To develop a tissue bank of tumor tissue from patients with non-metastatic esophageal
      adenocarcinoma.

      III. To determine molecular correlates of complete pathologic response, disease-free
      survival, and overall survival for patients with HER2-overexpressing esophageal
      adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant and maintenance trastuzumab.

      IV. To evaluate predictors of cardiotoxicity in patients with esophageal cancer treated with
      trastuzumab and chemoradiation.

      V. To evaluate adverse events associated with the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality
      treatment for patients with non-metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment improves the
      patient-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Esophageal Cancer (FACT-E)
      Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) score.

      II. To determine if an improvement in the FACT-E ECS score at 6-8 weeks post completion of
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation correlates with pathologic complete response.

      III. To determine if pathologic complete response correlates with the FACT-E ECS score at 1
      year and/or 2 years from the start of chemoradiation.

      IV. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment improves the
      Swallow Index and Eating Index Subscale scores of the FACT-E.

      V. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation
      impacts quality-adjusted survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

This standard treatment is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of SCCHN. VTX-2337 is an experimental drug that activates multiple components of the bodys immune system. The goal of this research study is to compare the standard treatment to VTX-2337 plus standard treatment to see if it helps stop growth or shrinks the cancer tumors and helps research participants with SCCHN live longer. Researchers also want to determine the side effects of the experimental combination of standard treatment and VTX-2337. In addition to the treatment part of this study, researchers plan to test samples of the research participant's tumor tissue and some of their blood to examine the impact of the study drug on tumor tissue and specific blood cells and substances. Researchers also want to know if the research participant's genes (DNA) affect how their body responds to or breaks down the study drug. This study will enroll approximately 175 subjects in North America.   About 8 participants will take part in the study at USC.This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VTX-2337 in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab in prolonging the progression-free survival in subjects with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.Subjects will be screened for eligibility and qualified subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment groups: SOC + VTX-2337 SOC + placeboThe treatment period is split into two phases: initial treatment and subsequent treatment. The initial treatment includes six 21-day cycles where you will receive cisplatin or carboplatin, 5-FU, cetuximab, and study drug. Starting with Cycle 7, treatment with cisplatin/carboplatin and 5-FU will be discontinued and you will continue to receive study drug and cetuximab. Cycles 7 onwards are 28-day cycles instead of 21-day cycles. You will continue to receive cetuximab and study drug until your disease gets worse or you can no longer tolerate the treatment.Upon independent confirmation of disease progression, active participation in the study is complete and subjects will undergo the End of Treatment evaluations.Subjects will be followed for survival until ~12 months after the last subject is randomized.Adverse events and safety will be evaluated throughout the study by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB will also conduct an assessment of the safety and tolerability of the starting dose.Randomization of all subjects will be stratified by prior chemotherapy (yes or no), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and platinum therapy as assigned by the investigator at the time of randomization (cisplatin or carboplatin).Sample size: n=175 subjects.Power, alpha and hazard ratio assumptions",HS-13-00734,Anayansi,Miloud,Anayansi.miloud@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 2 - takes the treatment one step further, assessing the activity of a particular therapy in a disease, often building upon leads from the Phase I trial.

Advances in our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying tumor progression have suggested several therapeutic targets, but the precise role of targeted agents in carcinoid has not been established.  Results of this study could lay the foundation for future trials in first line treatment of carcinoid.As the primary objective of this study progression-free survival will be compared between participants randomized to treatment with pazopanib versus placebo.This is a randomized, double-blind trial. Participants will be randomized with equal probability to treatment with pazopanib or placebo. With 150 participants enrolled over 25 months (6 per month) and a follow-up period of 12 months, 85% power is achieved to detect the difference between a median PFS of 14 months with pazopanib and 9 months for placebo.   Study participants will be instructed to take pazopanib or placebo every day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  For the purposes of this study, participants should be reevaluated every 3 cycles (12 weeks). In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained no less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.   After progression, participants will be followed for survival and second malignancy every 6 months until death or 5 years after registration.   Study participants may re-register at the time of progression.  Upon confirmation of progression by the Imaging Core Lab, participants may elect to be unblinded to their treatment assignment. Participants who were initially assigned to placebo will have the option to receive open label pazopanib.Interim analyses for futility (PFS comparison between treatment arms) will be conducted when 38% and 75% of the expected number of events (d = 114) have been observed. The first interim analysis is expected to occur during the accrual period at approximately 18 months from trial activation (n=108 patients enrolled); the second interim analysis is expected during the follow-up period at approximately 28 months from activation. Study enrollment will not be suspended for interim analyses.  Overall survival OS will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method within each treatment arm.This study will also be measuring EORTC QLQ-C30, NET 21 module, and linear analogue self-assessment.

While patients are generally required to be previously untreated, participation in a Phase II trial doesn't usually preclude the patient from getting the standard treatment after they've received the investigational agent. At best they are allowed to get a new drug they wouldn't be able to get otherwise that may turn out to be better for their disease.","Inclusion Criteria:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether the addition of cetuximab to postoperative intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy (IMRT) will improve overall survival (OS) in patients with locally
           advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck at intermediate risk following
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on disease-free
           survival (DFS) of these patients.

        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on acute and late
           dysphagia, xerostomia, skin toxicity, and other toxicities according to common Toxicity
           Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), v. 4 and their relationships with
           patient-reported outcomes at 3, 12, and 24 months.

        -  Analyze tumor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), specifically the extent of
           EGFR overexpression by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and FISH analysis, EGFRvIII
           expression, as well as the association of these assay data with OS and DFS.

        -  Analyze tumor for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (as defined by in situ
           hybridization), specifically, within the cohort of patients with oropharynx cancer, to
           perform an exploratory analysis of the impact of HPV on DFS and OS of this patient
           subset.

        -  Analyze tumor DNA for TP53 mutations as a predictor of response to cetuximab and
           prognosis.

        -  Analyze germline DNA of polymorphic variants in EGFR intron repeats as a predictor of
           response to cetuximab.

      Tertiary

        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on loco-regional
           control.

        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on
           patient-reported quality of life, swallowing, xerostomia, and skin toxicity based on
           head and neck specific instruments, including the Performance Status Scale for Head and
           Neck Cancer (PSS-HN), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head & Neck
           (FACT-H&N), the University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale
           (XeQOLS), and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on cost-utility
           analysis using the EuroQol (EQ-5D).

        -  Evaluate the utility of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) as a means of enhancing the
           efficacy (i.e., loco-regional control) of IMRT while reducing the acute and/or late
           toxicity (particularly xerostomia) and improving patient-reported outcomes
           (particularly XeQOLS scores).

        -  Retrospectively compare the loco-regional control rate in patients treated with IMRT
           alone (no IGRT or cetuximab) with similar patients treated with external beam
           radiotherapy alone in the postoperative clinical trial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
           (RTOG)-95 01.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical stage
      (T2-3 vs T4a), EGFR expression (high [ƒ? 80% of cells staining positive] vs low [< 80% of
      cells staining positive] vs not evaluable), primary site of disease (oral cavity vs larynx
      vs oropharynx p16+ vs oropharynx p16- vs oropharynx, p16 not evaluable), and use of
      image-guided radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily 5 days a
           week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo IMRT as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2
           hours once weekly beginning at least 5 days prior to the start of IMRT and continuing
           for 4 weeks after the completion of IMRT (for a total of 11 doses) in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months.

      Tissue samples are collected periodically for further laboratory analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.",HS-12-00691,,,,Drug,"Phase 3 - a treatment has shown activity against a particular disease, where it is either added to existing treatment or compared to the standard treatment.","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

      and despite effective antivirals causes significant morbidity and mortality (estimated
      24,000-50,000 deaths each year in the United States alone). The influenza virus that emerged
      in 2009 (A/California/07/2009 H1N1) caused fewer deaths (12,000 flu-related deaths in the
      U.S) but in contrast to seasonal flu, nearly 90 percent of the deaths with the 2009 H1N1
      occurred among people younger than 65 years of age. The CDC has defined an at-risk
      population that is responsible for the majority of hospitalization and morbidity associated
      with influenza. This study will evaluate the use of combination antivirals as compared to
      oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza in an at-risk population.

      Subjects who meet the CDC definition for being at-risk and that present with an
      influenza-like illness will be screened for the study. Those subjects with a confirmatory
      test for influenza (rapid antigen or PCR) will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive a
      blinded study treatment consisting of either the combination of amantadine, oseltamivir, and
      ribavirin or oseltamivir alone for 5 days. Clinical, virologic, and laboratory assessments
      on Days 1,  3,  7,  14, and 28 will be used for both safety and efficacy analysis.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of combined treatment with oseltamivir, amantadine, and
      ribavirin compared with oseltamivir alone for at-risk individuals with confirmed influenza
      infection.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have one or more medical conditions that may
      cause complications from influenza, and have developed an influenza-like illness.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, along
           with blood tests and throat swabs to confirm influenza infection.

        -  Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to take either oseltamivir alone (the
           current standard treatment for influenza) or to take oseltamivir, amantadine, and
           ribavirin. Participants will have additional blood samples and throat swabs taken at
           the start of the study, and will be shown how to complete a study diary at home.

        -  Participants will receive a study medication kit containing the medication to take at
           home twice a day for 5 days.

        -  Participants will return, with the medication kit, to the clinic on days 1 (the first
           day after the start of the study),  3,  7, 14, and 28. The first visit may take 2 to 3

This underscores the need for effective therapy in this disease. One approved treatment  in these patients is high dose aldesleukin. It has shown reductions in tumor size, as well as complete responses, but is highly toxic and appropriate for only a limited group of patients. Other therapies are needed to treat this disease. A new group of compounds called HDAC inhibitors prevent the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells and have shown strong anti-tumor activity. One HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has shown significant anti-tumor activity in renal cell cancer (RCC) . Previous animal and Phase I studies with the combination of high dose aldesleukin and entinostat have shown greater anti-tumor effect compared to use with either agent alone. This study is a Phase I/II study that will evaluate the safety and tolerability and monitor the toxicity and effectiveness of the combination of high dose aldesleukin and entinostat in patients with RCC that has spread.Patients who will be enrolled for this study will have laboratory confirmed RCC whose disease has spread or cannot be removed surgically and who have not received prior treatment for RCC. Once participants sign the informed consent and are deemed eligible for the study, participants will be enrolled in Phase II. Phase I has been completed and the maximum tolerated dose has been determined for Phase II. Participants will be treated at this dose level to study the effectiveness and side effects of the study drugs. Participants enrolled will have the following tests and procedures done: physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, assessment of side effects, review of medications, EKG and MUGA to assess heart function, and x-ray or CT or MRI scans. Subjects may have an optional biopsy of their tumor before and after they receive the first dose of study drugs. Each study cycle is 84 days. Subjects will be evaluated every 8-12 weeks for response. They will continue to have study visits every 4 weeks and receive the study drugs until their disease progresses, they cannot tolerate the side effects, they develop another medical condition or need for treatment while on study that prohibits them from continuing in the study, they withdraw consent or the sponsor stops the study. Subjects will be followed 30 days after stopping the study drugs and then every 3 months for survival.The primary endpoint is overall response rate (complete plus partial). Failure rates will be used to compare the progression-free survival, overall survival and time-to-tumor progression The association between responses and baseline laboratory parameters will be summarized graphically (boxplots, scatterplots, Kaplan-Meier curves) and numerically (means, medians).  The Cox proportional hazards model will be used to model the effect of these parameters on time-to-event outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to explore the relationship between entinostat exposure with pharmacodynamic endpoints.

Surgery can potentially cure disease that has not spread, although disease can return after surgery in up to 50% of cases. No therapy after surgery has been shown to reduce this risk. Also, as many as one-third of newly diagnosed patients with RCC have disease that has spread at the time of diagnosis and it is unlikely to be cured. Several anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFR) therapies have been approved for the treatment of RCC. These therapies inhibit the formation of blood vessels and tumor growth. Despite these advances in therapy, the majority of cases of advanced RCC remain incurable and resistance to treatment usually develops. The angiopoietin-Tie signaling system is another signaling pathway that is involved in blood vessel development and maintenance. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) are ligands of Tie2. AMG 386 is a novel drug that targets Ang1 and Ang2, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Previous studies have shown that the combination of AMG 386 with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors was associated with greater anti-tumor activities than when compared with each agent alone. This trial will evaluate AMG 386 alone or AMG 386 plus bevacizumab, pazopanib, sorafenib, or sunitinib after progression on at least one line of anti-VEGF therapy for RCC. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the overall response rate of AMG 386 alone and in combination with continuation of previously administered bevacizumab, pazopanib, sorafenib, or sunitinib in advanced RCC.Patients who will be enrolled for this study will have laboratory confirmed cancer whose disease has spread or cannot be removed surgically and for which standard treatments are no longer effective. Once participants sign the informed consent and are deemed eligible for the study, participants with will be randomized to receive either AMG 386 alone or AMG 386 plus their prior anti-VEGF treatment (bevacizumab, pazopanib, sorafenib, or sunitinib). During the study, all participants will have the following procedures done:  physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, performance status, assessment of side effects, review of medications, electrocardiogram to assess heart function, and tumor assessments with radiographic scans every 12 weeks. All participants will stop taking study drug(s) if their disease worsens, they have another illness which prevents them from taking the study drug(s), they cannot tolerate the side effects, they withdraw from the study, or their study doctor thinks that being on the study is no longer in their best interest. All participants will be followed for 4-8 weeks after stopping the study drug(s) or until death.The primary endpoint of this trial is treatment efficacy evaluated by overall tumor response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria in each treatment arm. The overall tumor response rate is defined as the total number of efficacy-evaluable patients who achieve a complete or partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. In this study we will define as efficacy-evaluable, any eligible patient who began therapy and received any amount of the first dose of AMG 386.",HS-13-00614,Maria,Brown,Maria.Brown@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 2 - takes the treatment one step further, assessing the activity of a particular therapy in a disease, often building upon leads from the Phase I trial.

However, approximately 50% of AVFs will lose primary patency within the first year. This is primarily due to vascular scarring, that leads to progressive lumen narrowing and manifests as diminished AVF blood flow, venous hypertension, and thrombosis. Patency loss is addressed via interventional procedures such as thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty, surgical revision, or abandonment of the access site. Interventions to restore or maintain patency are characterized by poor post-intervention patency. Approximately 50% of the AVFs require re-intervention within 1 year possibly due to vessel injury caused by the intervention. A local treatment that safely prolonged primary unassisted patency of a radiocephalic AVF could increase the success of AVF surgery, increase the chance that patients would dialyze with an AVF, reduce the number of procedures to restore or maintain AVF patency, and prolong secondary patency.This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of PRT-201 administered immediately after AVF creation. PRT-201 is a locally acting type I pancreatic elastase that in the appropriate dose and setting can enlarge blood vessels, increase blood flow.  Study objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of PRT-201 administered immediately after radiocephalic AVF creation.Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either PRT-201 0.03 mg or placebo. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 1-day treatment period, and up to 12 months of follow-up. Patients signing informed consent will have agreed to be enrolled into a patient Registry; if after 12 months AVF is being used for hemodialysis or may be used for hemodialysis in the future the additional information about AVF will be collected for 2 years or until AVF is no longer used for hemodialysis. About 300 participants will take part in the study at 30 centers. The primary efficacy endpoint is AVF primary unassisted patency defined as the time from AVF creation until the first occurrence of either access thrombosis or procedure to restore or maintain AVF patency. The secondary efficacy endpoint is secondary patency that is defined as the time from AVF creation until AVF abandonment.The sponsor will conduct the statistical analysis to assess the safety and efficacy. The primary analysis will be performed once all patients have completed the Month 12 visit.

These drugs have side effets including renal injury and therefore the development of newer antirejection drugs continues.  One new drug recently approved for prophylaxis againts rejection in the kidney transplant recipient is belatacept.  This drug works by a different mechanism of action and is given intravenously at approximately one month intervals after the initial doses.  The purpose of ths study is to evaluate belatacept in renal transplant recipients who are converted from a calcineurin inhibitor to belatacept and administered the drug over a two year period.  Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either remain on the calcineurin inhibitor or convert to belatacept.  Both groups will receive mycophenolate mofetil (or another similar agent) and steroids which are routinely used in this patient population.  Participants will be closely monitored over the next two years and for an additional period thereafter for adverse events, renal function, and rejection episodes.  Post tranplant lymphoproliferative disease is a complicaton of immunosuppression and it was found in prior studies that there were more cases in patients randomized to belatacept that calcineurin inhibitorrs.  In addition, there was more involved of the central nervous system.  The group at greatest risk were patients who had negative serology for EBV and these were therefore excluded from studies later on.  Particular attention will be paid to monitoring for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease through exams, neurologic assessments and additonal evaluation as indicated.

There are approximately 12,000 new cases of Acute myeloid leukemia in the US per year, and allogeneic stem cell transplant may cure 35-50% of these cases.It is believed that HLA-mismatched allogeneic cellular therapy (HMMACT) harnesses a powerful immunologic tool for achieving complete remission in acute leukemias without fewer risks of transplantation or limitations as nearly all patients will have an available donor.The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of cytarabine based chemotherapy and HLA-mismatched allogeneic cellular therapy (HMMACT) in patients with high risk AML, with feasibility measured by induction mortality (IM) and complete response rate.Eligible AML patients will receive induction chemotherapy with mitoxantrone (IV, 3 days) and cytarabine (IV, 7 days) and receive HLA-mismatched G-PBSCs on day 9 or 10. Family donors will concurrently be HLA typed and best available donor will undergo donor screening.This is a Pilot/Feasability study.  The primary measures of feasibility will be (1) induction mortality (IM) and (2) complete remission (CR or CRi).   Secondary assessments of feasibility will involve safety as measured by the occurrence of serious infections (Grade 4), time to recovery of absolute neutrophil counts and platelets, and incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD).  An additional assessment of feasibility will be the ability to identify a suitable donor in this elderly population.  It is expected that between 60% and 80% patients will have a suitable donor; therefore it is anticipated (assuming that only 60% of patients have a donor) that 33-35 patients will be initially recruited to the trial.  The number of 20 patients (who actually receive a stem cell infusion) was selected to permit preliminary estimates of toxicities, CRR, EFS and OS.   Standard errors (based on 20 patients) for the proportion of patients who experience a CR or IM or GvHD will be 0.11.Follow-up for survival will be done monthly for 3 years or until death.

","This study is for participants that have advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) that did not respond or has progressed (worsened) after treatment with other drugs. This study will use the experimental drug cabozantinib (XL184). Cabozantinib has not been approved by any regulatory authority (for example the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] or European Medicines Agency [EMA]). Cabozantinib is a drug taken by mouth, and is believed to work by inhibiting tumor growth and spread.  It has been approved for use in the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in the United States and is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of various other cancer types, including liver cancer.The purpose of this study is to find out if cabozantinib is effective in treating liver cancer. This study will also examine how safe cabozantinib is and how well people with liver cancer tolerate cabozantinib.  About 760 participants will take part in the study, with about 5 taking part at USC.This is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial ofcabozantinib vs placebo, both with best supportive care.This research study consists of three periods: a Screening or Pre-Treatment Period, a Treatment Period, and a Post-Treatment or Follow Up Period. The participants will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin), in a 2:1 ratio, to one of two treatment groups: either 60 mg of cabozantinib or 60 mg of placebo This is a double-blind study. Neither the participants, nor the study doctor, nor the sponsor will know which treatment (cabozantinib or placebo) the participants will receive. In the event of an emergency, the study doctor can determine which treatment a participant is receiving.Overall survival is the primary objective of this study.  Secondary endpoints are objective response rate and progression-free survival.  Additional endpoints are:  safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), relationship of baseline and changes in biomarkers with treatment and/or clinical outcome and health-related quality of life.The participants will return to the clinic approximately 30 days after they have stopped receiving the study treatments for a follow up visit. The study is planned to start in third quarter 2013. It is estimated that 25 months will berequired to randomize approximately 760 subjects. The number of events required for theprimary analyses of OS is expected to be observed approximately 38 months after thefirst subject is randomized.It is estimated that subjects will participate for an average of 3 to 5 months on studytreatment. Subjects will be followed until death, withdrawal of consent from the study, orSponsor decision to no longer collect these data.The primary efficacy analysis in this study is the comparison of overall survival (OS) insubjects treated with cabozantinib versus placebo.  For the primary endpoint, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The final analysis of OS is event-driven and will be conducted after at least 621 deaths have been observed.Progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are the secondaryendpoints. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of either diseaseprogression per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the investigator or death from any cause.ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a confirmed complete response(CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1.",HS-13-00704,Anayansi,Miloud,Anayansi.miloud@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 3 - a treatment has shown activity against a particular disease, where it is either added to existing treatment or compared to the standard treatment.","Select Inclusion Criteria:

The variety of genetic mutations present in NSCLC has led to questions about the appropriate clinical application of genotyping technologies. Clinical selection strategies to identify appropriate populations for genetic mutations that respond to targeted therapies are needed for the efficient application of genotyping technologies. A previous study found a significant trend towards a younger age in patients with cancers with certain genetic mutations and suggests that young age may be a disease marker of lung cancer biology. The population we propose to study is lung cancer patients of a young age (less than 40 years old) to determine whether targetable mutations are greater in young adults with lung cancer than in the greater lung cancer population by testing their tissue and blood samples. Patients who will be enrolled for this study will have laboratory confirmed lung cancer and be less than 40 years of age at diagnosis. Once participants sign the informed consent and are deemed eligible for the study, participants will have tissue and blood collected. Participants' tissue and blood will undergo genetic testing. Any leftover tissue or blood will be kept for future research use. Participants will be followed every 3 months for up to 3 years to obtain information about their cancer status and treatments.A one-sided 0.07-level exact binomial test will be used to assess whether or not targetable mutations are greater in the study population than in the greater lung cancer population that will be represented by patients in the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium. The proportion of young lung cancer patients that enrolled onto clinical trials and that received targeted therapies will be estimated using a one-sided  95% exact confidence interval.

      accounting for 85% of cases. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay of patients with
      NSCLC; however, survival rates remain low and toxicity is significant. Molecularly targeted
      therapies have proven to be superior to chemotherapy for NSCLC patients whose tumors have
      mutations in EGFR. Recent studies have established tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the
      gold standard for treating EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC.  However, patients on TKIs
      eventually progress, and in approximately 50% of cases, progression is due to development of
      an additional mutation called T790M.  There are currently no approved therapies for patients
      who progress on TKIs. Rociletinib may provide an effective therapy for a patient population
      with few alternative treatment options. Nonclinical data demonstrate that rociletinib
      inhibits T790M.  It is anticipated that rociletinib may promote cell death in tumor cells
      with the T790M mutation, thus providing possible therapeutic benefit in patients who have
      developed T790M-mediated resistance to first generation TKIs.

      This is a two-part, open-label study of oral rociletinib administered daily in previously
      treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR
      gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib, gefitinib or
      afatinib.

      This study will include 2 parts:

      Phase 1 (completed enrolment):  Dose-escalation Period with 21-day cycles; optional
      Treatment Extension Period starting on Day 22

      Phase 2 (currently enrolling): Evaluation of activity and safety in patients with the T790M
      EGFR mutation who have:

      Cohort A - Progressed on EGFR directed therapy (irrespective of the number and order of
      previous lines of NSCLC therapy) or Cohort B - Progression on the first single agent EGFR
      directed therapy received and also had no more than one previous line of chemotherapy",HS-14-00145,,,,Drug,"Phase 2 - takes the treatment one step further, assessing the activity of a particular therapy in a disease, often building upon leads from the Phase I trial. While patients are generally required to be previously untreated, participation in a Phase II trial doesn't usually preclude the patient from getting the standard treatment after they've received the investigational agent. At best they are allowed to get a new drug they wouldn't be able to get otherwise that may turn out to be better for their disease.","Inclusion Criteria -

The current standard frontline regimen is cisplatin-pemetrexed which yields a 12.1 month median overall survival and 5.7 month median time to progression. This regimen has been an advance in mesothelioma treatment, but its associated toxicities and survival results remain grim. A new paradigm in treatment is needed with identification of new targets of therapy and novel combination regimens.The primary objective of the Phase II portion of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cediranib in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in comparison with cisplatin, pemetrexed and placebo in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.In this portion of the study participants will have 6 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed, and randomized to receive cediranib (investigational drug) or placebo, followed by maintenance cediranib or placebo. After disease progression, follow-up will occur  every 6 months for the first two years and then at the end of the third year after registration.Study participants will be randomized using a dynamic balancing algorithm with stratification based on (53):  performance status: 0 or 1 versus 2 and histologic subtype: epitheliod versus biphasic/sarcomatoid.  Based on a previous study it is assumed that the regimen would not be promising if the true median PFS were  6 months, but would be of considerable interest if the true median PFS were  10 months (corresponding to a 1.66 hazard ratio). (2) Ninety-six patients will be accrued over an estimated 24 months. With an additional 9 months of follow-up, this design has 83% power to detect 66% improvement in median PFS at the 0.1 level.  Primary analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A stratified log-rank test at the 0.1 level will be used to test the primary hypothesis.  Once 50% of the expected events in the control arm have occurred (21 events at ~ 18months after study opens), an interim analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed with the intent of testing the alternative hypothesis (e.g. terminate early if a 1.66 hazard ratio is deemed to be highly unlikely [p<0.005]).",HS-11-00712,Maria,Brown,Maria.Brown@med.usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 2 - takes the treatment one step further, assessing the activity of a particular therapy in a disease, often building upon leads from the Phase I trial.

This pathway can be activated by alterations in specific proteins, including BRAF. GSK2118436 (Dabrefenib), is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity with a mode of action consistent with adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibition. GSK1120212 (Trametinib) is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. Preclinical research in NSCLC cell lines shows combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib were synergistic with enhancing cell growth inhibition in the BRAF V600E mutation positive NSCLC cell line.The primary objective of the study is tTo assess the overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with stage IV BRAF V600E mutant non-small cell lung cancer that have disease progression on at least 1 line of prior anti-cancer treatment for metastatic disease administered dabrafenib alone and in combination with trametinib.

SBRT is a radiation technique that allows for conformal delivery of very high doses of radiation, using numerous beams. Minimally invasive lung wedge resection of the lesion of interest and a mediastinal lymph node dissection can be accomplished with a robotic-assisted technique.
A novel combination of Sublobar Resection and radiation therapy is proposed, with preoperative SBRT, to decrease the rates of failure at the primary site or the regional sites. Stereotactic radiation has shown to provide dramatically improved local control rates compared to traditional therapy, with locoregional control rates around 90%, and cancer specific survival rates greater than 80%.


Eligible patients will undergo Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy. About 4-6 weeks after radiation, Surgery of the treated tumor will be performed. Follow up procedures will include at least a post-operative visit (1month), 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year visits.

The goal of the planned laboratory correlative studies is to obtain exploratory data about the utility of molecular blood-based biomarkers as companion diagnostics for lung cancer treatment and response. Ultimately, such molecular biomarkers might be used as an early measure of whether patients are responding to treatment or of recurrence.

The primary endpoint is to establish the safety and feasibility of SBRT followed by wedge resection for peripherally located early stage Non small cell lung cancer

Demographic and clinical baseline data, total dose of radiation received, duration of SBRT treatment, time from end of SBRT to surgery, reasons for not completing the regimen as planned, toxicities/SAEs, surgical complications experienced, OR time, total blood loss, pathologic response rates, time to local recurrence, and time to recurrence will be summarized using standard descriptive methods.  Associations will be displayed visually with scatterplots or contingency tables.

","There is a definite need for more effective and less toxic treatment approaches for lymphoma.  This clinical study will be a unique opportunity to measure and characterize the baseline immune parameters and assess and compare the immune modulating effects of ipilimumab with rituximab in patients with previously treated CD20+ B-cell lymphoma.The primary objective of this study is to determine a recommended Phase II dose for ipilimumab in combination with rituximab. Study participants will receive Ipilimumab once every three weeks for four doses and Rituximab once a week for four weeks.  When participants are finished taking their fourth dose of Ipilimumab and their fourth dose of Rituximab and have not had any serious side effects, the participant will be given maintenance therapy. During Maintenance: Ipilimumab and rituximab will be given approximately every 12 weeks on the same day for 1 year. Study participants will be asked to take study drugs for 15 months. This study will have a dose escalation phase (Part 1) followed by an expansion at the recommended Phase II dose (Part 2).  At the expansion, 20 patients (10/arm) will be randomized to receive their first dose of ipilimumab on Day 1 or Day 15  in order to evaluate the immune response to rituximab with and without ipilimumab.  Decisions to escalate or expand a dose level will be based on induction portion of the regimen (defined as the first 2 doses of ipilimumab and first 4 doses of rituximab).

Lymphoid malignancies are hematologic malignancies where relapses remain frequent despite aggressive chemoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation, and where molecular targeted agents are particularly promising therapeutic options. Overexpression of aurora kinase A has been noted in aggressive lymphomas and is associated with a poor prognosis. The principal objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the study drug, MLN8237 when given in combination with vorinostat and to select a dose and schedule for further testing(recommended Phase 2 dose). MLN8237 is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and reversible inhibitor of aurora kinase A. It has been noted that MLN8237 has an antiproliferative effect in cell lines derived from a variety of malignancies;including colon, lung, breast, prostate, ovary, pancreas, and lymphoid. The combination of MLN8237 and vorinostat are being used since it may produce more robust responses in these patients, compared to only the aurora kinase A inhibitor alone. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. A modified rolling 3+2 design will be employed for dose escalation. Study participants will be followed for the duration of study and for at least 30 days following the last dose of study drug or until death, whichever occurs first.Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria. The primary endpoint is the evaluation of toxicity and estimation of the MTD of MLN8237 when combined with vorinostat. The maximum accrual for this study, assumes the unlikely possibility that all dose levels on both schedules accrue 6 patients (=48 patients), in addition to the expanded cohort of 12 patients (maximum total = 60 patients). Once the MTD has been determined, an expanded cohort of 12 patients will be added at the recommended Phase II dose to better explore toxicities and for pharmacokinetic testing of MLN8237.The study participant may voluntarily donate left over tissue for future research.

      I. To evaluate and compare progression free survival (PFS) of two different doses of
      carfilzomib with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma (MM) patients with relapsed and/or
      refractory disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare response rates (RR) for each arm. II. To evaluate response rates
      (RR) for patients that relapse on low dose carfilzomib and subsequently cross-over to high
      dose carfilzomib.

      III. To evaluate the safety of this combination for this patient population. IV. To evaluate
      overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the molecular variability in MM cells obtained from extramedullary bone marrow
      relapse sites.

      II. To explore the role of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in assessing disease
      burden and as a tool to assess treatment response.

      2-10 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Patients with progression cross-over to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and high-dose carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.

      Note that for the first course of treatment on both arms carfilzomib is given at a reduced
      rate to assess toxicity.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease

Until recently, gemcitabine was the only agent with reproducible activity and resulting in a median survival of only 5-6 months.  Despite attempts to improve the outcome by adding a second agent to gemcitabine, no worthwhile progress has been made thus far. There are grounds for optimism as two new regimens (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) have emerged as front line options. The study drug, recombinant pegylated human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) is widely used to enhance subcutaneous dispersion and absorption of various agents. It has shown to inhibit tumor growth, and enhance effects of chemotherapy in mouse models of cancer.  Plus, other studies have shown the PEGPH20 can damage the outer layer of a tumor which can let more chemotherapy reach the tumor and possibly increase effectiveness. The study will be conducted in two sequential parts. A participant may be enrolled to either the Phase I Portion or the Phase II Portion. The Phase I portion will be a dose de-escalation clinical trial with two dose levels of PEGPH20. For the Phase II portion of the study (which will be temporarily closed to define the dose of PEGPH20) will have two treatment arms (Arm 1-mFolfirinox and Arm 2-PEGPH20+mFolfirinox). All study participants will be followed until death or 3 years after registration.  The primary Phase 1 objective is to assess the safety of mFOLFIRINOX in combination with PEGPH20 and select the optimal dose of PEGPH20 for the Phase II portion in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  While the Phase II objective is to assess the overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with mFOLFIRINOX + PEGPH20 compared to those treated with mFOLFIRINOX alone.  Assuming a 10% ineligibility rate, 7-20 study participants will be accrued to yield 6-18 eligible participants for the Phase I portion of the trial and 152 participants will be accrued to yield 138 eligible participants for the Phase II portion of the trial.  The study will require 2 years of accrual, 1.5 years of follow-up, type 1 error of 10%, and 80% power.  For the Phase II trial, study participants will be stratified according to Zubrod Performance Status: 0 vs. 1.  The primary analysis of overall survival will be conducted in all eligible patients according to the intent-to-treat principle, using the logrank test. The final analysis will take place upon the observation of approximately 110 deaths.

OMP-54F28 is a recombinant fusion binds all Wnt proteins tested and thereby antagonizes Wnt-activated signaling. Recent studies showed that Wnt pathway inhibition by OMP-54F28 was highly effective in combination with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, quite often leading to tumor regression.Primary Objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OMP-54F28 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated Stage IV pancreatic cancer and to identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and estimate the maximum tolerated dose of OMP-54F28 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated Stage IV pancreatic cancer.Study Period will be Approximately 12 to 21 months.OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

This study is being performed as a prelude to evaluation of the potential utility of this combination in patients with pancreatic carcinoma with no proven clinical therapeutic options.There is a strong correlation between Wnt signaling and the onset of cancer  due to its involvement in the fate of stem cells.  PRI-724 acts by inhibiting Beta-catenin, the intracellular transducer in  Wnt pathway. PRI-724 has been shown to have activity alone and in combination with gemcitabine against pancreatic tumors in in vitro as well as in in vivo experiments in mice. The potential role of the Wnt pathway in pancreatic cancer suggests that the  PRI-724 has the potential to inhibit tumor stem or initiating cells, to inhibit fibrosis and decrease stroma formation, and to impact metastatic potential.Approximately 30 patients will be accrued in the study, out of which 7 will be taking part at USC.Both gemcitabine and PRI-724 will be given on a 4 week cycle.  Participants will receive gemcitabine on Week 1, 2 and 3. Week 4 of the study is referred to as the gemcitabine rest week.  Participants will receive PRI-724 on Week 1 and Week 3 of the study.  Week 2 and Week 4 of the study are referred to as the PRI-724 rest weeks.  The first 4-week period of gemcitabine and PRI-724 dosing will be considered Cycle 1 of the study. Subjects will continue receiving cycles of gemcitabine and PRI-724 as long as this treatment is effective against the disease, provided they tolerate any side effects from this therapy.End of Treatment evaluations are to be conducted within approximately one week following the last dose of study drug. One Month Follow-up safety evaluation will be conducted in all patients. This period will be extended if any toxicity thought to be associated with study drug or the study drug/gemcitabine combination has not resolved, returned to baseline status, or been adequately explained.The clinical endpoint of this Phase 1b trial is determination of the MTD of study drug/gemcitabine combination that can be administered on the specified schedules.Statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.0 or later.

response following treatment with radium-223 dichloride alone or in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have bone metastases.

Bone metastases are the main cause of disability and death in subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Radium-223 dichloride is a calcium mimetic, alpha-emitting nuclide, which selectively targets areas of increased bone turnover in bone metastases.

All participants will receive the approved, standard dose regimen of radium-223 dichloride, 50 kBq/kg every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses. 
Subjects in Treatment group 1 will receive only radium-223 dichloride using the standard dose. Subjects in Treatment group 2 will receive abiraterone acetate daily and prednisone concurrently with standard dose radium-223 dichloride. 
Subjects in Treatment group 3 will receive enzalutamide daily concurrently with standard dose radium-223 dichloride.

Primary objective is to test whether subjects experience bone scan response at Week 24 based on the quantified technetium-99 bone scan lesion area following randomization to treatment with one of the three regimens.

The primary endpoint, patient bone scan response at Week 24, will be evaluated by the central imaging reviewer based on the technetium-99 bone scans collected by the investigator at the Week 24 assessment

      Primary

        -  Demonstrate an overall survival (OS) advantage in patients with intermediate-risk
           prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy (RT) with versus without
           short-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT versus RT alone improves
           clinical failures, biochemical failure by the ""nadir +2"", freedom from failure, rate of
           salvage ADT, and prostate cancer-specific mortality in these patients.

        -  Estimate the magnitude of benefit of ADT with respect to OS in patients treated with
           different RT modalities (i.e., external-beam radiation therapy alone vs low-dose rate
           brachytherapy boost vs high-dose rate brachytherapy boost).

        -  Compare acute and late treatment adverse events of these regimens and correlate these
           events with the presence or absence of pre-existing comorbidity as documented by the
           Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 assessment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of radiotherapy. Patients are
      stratified according to number of risk factors (1 vs 2-3), comorbidity (ACE-27 grade ƒ? 2 vs
      < 2), and radiotherapy (RT) modality (dose-escalated external-beam RT [EBRT] vs EBRT and
      low-dose rate brachytherapy boost vs EBRT and high-dose rate brachytherapy boost). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo EBRT* once daily on days 1-5 for about 9 weeks (44 treatments).
           Some patients instead receive EBRT with high-dose rate or low-dose rate brachytherapy
           implant on days 1-5 for about 5 weeks (25 treatments). NOTE: *Type of RT is at
           discretion of treating physician and may include either 3D-conformal RT or
           intensity-modulated RT.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy comprising luteinizing-hormone
           releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, or triptorelin)
           subcutaneously or as an injection every 1 to 3 months AND an oral antiandrogen therapy
           (flutamide 3 times daily or bicalutamide once daily) for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks
           after the first LHRH injection, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

This submission is for the MRI component of the research study only, which is being performed for research purposes.There is a fundamental gap in our ability to design effective surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for the 30-40% of patients who cannot tolerate non-surgical treatment.  OSA surgery outcomes vary widely, with the chances of a successful outcome ranging from 5% to 65% for individual or combination procedures.  To predict  and thereby to improve  outcomes, we must determine what predicts surgical success.  This project will compare findings from two evaluations: drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) and upper airway magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  DISE has demonstrated important benefits, but it has important limitations.  Upper airway MRI is the most complete evaluation performed during wakefulness, making it conducive to broad application and less expensive than DISE, but there are no studies utilizing MRI as a surgical evaluation.  We propose a cross-sectional analysis of 50 adult subjects with moderate to severe OSA.  In addition to history, physical examination, and polysomnogram (sleep study), all subjects will undergo DISE and MRI to characterize the pattern of obstruction.  We will examine the association between DISE and MRI, focusing on specific DISE findings that have been associated with surgical outcomes.

GROUP STUDY OF THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF PREGABALIN (BID) IN
SUBJECTS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN","Post traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTPNP) is a nerve pain resulting from peripheral nerve trauma. Pregabalin (Lyrica) is an alpha-2-delta ligand that has analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant. This study, A0081279, is designed to investigate and confirm that pregabalin is effective in treating neuropathic pain. Primary Objective is to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin (150-600 mg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain.  Secondary Objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin compared with placebo to improve global assessment and to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin. The final number of subjects will be determined by the recommendation from data monitoring committee, not to exceed 700 subjects. This is a double blind parallel group study comprises 3 phases, a screening period (a minimum of 1 week), a 15-week double-blind period comprising 3 weeks of dose optimization and 12 weeks of fixed dose maintenance treatment, followed by a one week taper. All subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be dispensed single-blind placebo for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 14 days. At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects will be randomized to receive either pregabalin(150-600 mg/day pregabalin), or matching placebo.  Dose optimization will occur during Weeks 1-3 (between Visits 2 and 3). If the subject is unable to tolerate a higher dose, the dose may be reduced by one dose level as needed during the optimization period, and the dose may be increased or decreased per investigator discretion during the optimization period. Subjects unable to tolerate a minimum dose of 150 mg/day pregabalin (or matching placebo) will be discontinued from the study. Efficacy Endpoint is mean pain based on the NRS pain scores from the daily pain diaries while receiving study medication. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints are to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin compared with placebo to improve global assessment, Brief Pain Inventory, EuroQoL 5-Dimensions, Daily Sleep Interference Rating Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale and safety assessments. All subjects completing the study or discontinuing prematurely from the study will complete a follow-up visit after completion of medication taper that will be conducted by telephone. This visit may be performed in the clinic at the investigators discretion. Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by the sponsor. The primary analysis will be performed using the ITT (Intent to Treat) population. Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed using the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) population. An unblinded interim analysis is planned when at least 60% of the subjects have either completed or discontinued from the study, for sample size re-estimation. The unblended interim analysis will be performed under supervision of the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) statistician.",HS-13-00290,Salma,Akhter,sakhter@usc.edu,Drug,"Phase 3 - a treatment has shown activity against a particular disease, where it is either added to existing treatment or compared to the standard treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:
