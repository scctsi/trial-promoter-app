But somebody needs to start a campaign on the importance of privacy and how important less stress is in everybody's life.  It's not about how well we handle situations as it is less life lessons.  Know when enough is enough.  I bet when it's said and done you might even see people quit the cigarettes. But not like this that's the wrong approach.
